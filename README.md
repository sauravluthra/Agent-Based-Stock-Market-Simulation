# Agent-Based-Stock-Market-Simulation

An agent-based simulation in Python to study the effect of high-frequency traders on stock price volatility. 
Large institutional investors, retail investors, and high-frequency traders were simulated with different populations, trade frequencies, and order sizes.

The NumPy and Matplotlib libraries were implemented to help simulate agents with different behaviors, build an order book, and display price/volume data.  
The results of the simulation were consistent in showing that a greater proportion of high-frequency traders serves to increase stock price volatility. 
However, agent behavior must be further developed to more accurately simulate real-world behaviors and prevent uncontrolled price increases.

The results of this implementation were detailed in the attached .pdf file.
